## Ford-Data-Science-Portfolio

### Description: 
This repository houses all projects done in my spring 2026 Intro to Data Science course. Its content demonstates working proficiency in using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, and Streamlit and includes projects on topics such as data-driven web applications, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and LLMs. 

### Projects: 
#### Development of a Basic Streamlit App:
This project deploys python skills to build an interactive web application in Streamlit. My app, "What makes a Spotify song a Hit?", allows users to see how danceability and energy affect a song's popularity. Utilitizing page tabs and filters, users can visualize danceability's and energy's impact on popularity by music genre, album, or artist/artist group.
