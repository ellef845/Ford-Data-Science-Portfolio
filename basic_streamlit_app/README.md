### Description:

This folder encompasses all files for my basic streamlit app. My app, "What makes a Spotify Hit?", allows users to see how danceability and energy affect a song's popularity. Utilitizing page tabs and filters, users can visualize danceability's and energy's impact on popularity by music genre, album, or artist/artist group. This project exemplifies proficiency in Python and the development of an interactive webpage in Streamlit. 

#### Data: 
My app utilizes a Kaggle dataset titled "Spotify Tracks Dataset" which describes the musical characteristics of around 89,000 songs.

### Directions on how to run the app: 

1. Download the basic_streamlit_app folder
2. Go into your python terminal and give the command "streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py".
