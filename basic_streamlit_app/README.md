This folder encompasses all files for my basic streamlit app. My app utilizes a Kaggle dataset titled "Spotify Tracks Dataset" which describes the musical characteristics of around 89,000 songs. My app, "What makes a Spotify Hit?", allows users to see how danceability and energy affect a song's popularity. Utilitizing page tabs and filters, users can visualize these relationships by music genre, album, or artist/artist group. This project exemplifies proficiency in Python and the development of an interactive webpage in Streamlit.
